# SimpleBlog

This is an exercise about blog .In this Blog,we can learn how to use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)--
a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cn) rather than Django and sql Database.
  This is my first project about flask,and I use Bootstrap as Frontend to decorate my blog succinctly.this is why it named SimpleBlog.
